ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ivangriessel
I'm a Data analyst currently working in HealthTech in markets across Europe. I have a background in experience design, having worked as a Senior UX Designer before transitioning over to data analytics. I am naturally curious and always learning.

When I'm not in front of my computer I like to be outside hiking and on the water with my wife and our hungarian vizsla, Luna. I'm originally from Cape Town, South Africa, but now call the City of Norwich, England my home.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the power of data to drive decision-making and power tools that improve lives
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about data analytics, SQL, Python and Machine Learning
