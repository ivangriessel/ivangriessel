ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ivangriessel
I'm a Product designer currently working in HealthTech in markets across Europe.

When I'm not in front of my computer I like to be outside hiking and on the water with my wife and our hungarian vizsla, Luna. I'm originally from Cape Town, South Africa, but now call the City of Norwich, England my home.
